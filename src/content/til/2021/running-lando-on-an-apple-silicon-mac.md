While I've done some NodeJS based development on my M1 MacBook, I had been procrastinating on doing anything Docker based. I had an opportunity to take the plunge today and decided to go for it.

My understanding is that [this config is not officially supported](https://github.com/lando/lando/issues/2688) for a variety of reasons, ~~but for me it pretty much just worked~~.

Here's what I did:

* Downloaded and installed the [Docker M1 Tech Preview](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/apple-m1/)
* Downloaded the latest [Lando release](https://github.com/lando/lando/releases) (3.0.25 in my case)
* Installed Lando, being sure to customize the install to not install Docker Desktop over my existing tech preview.
* Created and started a Drupal 9 project ~~that just worked~~.

If I run into any quirks as I put it through the paces a bit more, I'll update this post.

**Update**: Quirks already :)

Upon further restarts things seemed to be getting hung up on the message `Scanning to determine which services are ready... Please standby... ?` I was able to get past this by adding the following to `.lando.yml` [as mentioned in this issue](https://github.com/lando/lando/issues/2281#issuecomment-632620604):

```yml
services:
  appserver:
    scanner: false
```

It works, but indicates that there is some mystery issue under the covers. So as the Lando installer says when I install using an existing version of Docker: YMMV.
