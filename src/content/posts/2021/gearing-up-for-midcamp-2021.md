[Midcamp](https://www.midcamp.org/), my local Drupal Camp, is back March 24 - 27. Midcamp went virtual at the beginning of lockdown last year and while it was a rousing success, we were definitely making it up as we went along. This time around we're trying a new format with an increased focus on community building which we're also hoping will help combat the Zoom fatigue we're all feeling. [The schedule](https://www.midcamp.org/2021/schedule) breaks down as follows:

- Wednesday, March 24: Get Started with Drupal - content focused on introducing attendees to Drupal.
- Thursday, March 25: Meet the Drupal Community - lightly structured community building activities.
- Friday, March 26: Share Your Knowledge - a one day [unconference format](http://unconference.net/unconferencing-how-to-prepare-to-attend-an-unconference/)
- Saturday, March 27: Give Back to the Project - Our traditional contribution day.

Within that schedule, here are a few things I'm extra excited about:

- In addition to our traditional Zoom rooms, we'll also have a space in [Gather.town](https://gather.town/) for us to virtually socialize. I've been spending some time moving around sprites, and expect to have some surprises in store.
- On Thursday, [Matt Glaman](https://www.drupal.org/u/mglaman) will be leading a workshop on writing JavaScript tests using [Nightwatch.js](https://nightwatchjs.org/)
- And on contribution day, one of the featured initiatives will be adding additional test coverage to Drupal's new [Olivero theme](https://www.drupal.org/about/core/strategic-initiatives/olivero).

[Registration](https://ti.to/midcamp/2021) is pay what you want, and we'd love to see you there.

With any luck we'll have an in-person component at Midcamp next year, which will also overlap with St. Patrick's day. I'm workshopping the following tagline: Midcamp 2022: IRL in IRL.
