I've been lucky enough to be a guest on a few Drupal related podcasts recently, continuing my long standing trend of talking to anyone who will listen.

[Drupal Easy Podcast](https://www.drupaleasy.com/podcast): Back in January, Mike Anello had me on to talk about Front End Components on [Episode 238](https://www.drupaleasy.com/podcast/2021/01/drupaleasy-podcast-238-front-end-components-beginners-brian-perry). We mostly focused on the basics, which was a nice change of pace compared to the component integration talk I had been giving recently.

[Talking Drupal](https://talkingdrupal.com/): the folks at Talking Drupal recently decided to have a rotating co-host seat for four week stretches and were nice enough to invite me to be the first to occupy the seat. During my four week run I was lucky enough to chat about:

- [Starting a Drupal Career](https://talkingdrupal.com/282) with Mike Anello (I swear Mike is following me)
- [Tugboat](https://talkingdrupal.com/283) with Matt Westgate
- [Iterative Approach To Decoupling](https://talkingdrupal.com/284) with me!
- [Decoupled Menus](https://talkingdrupal.com/285) with Gabe Sullice, Baddy Sonja Breidert, and Liam Hockley.

The Decoupled Menus discussion was especially enlightening as it clarified some of my misconceptions about the project (they aren't shipping a menu component, instead they are making enhancements to Drupal to better support many menu components) and also gave me some ideas about how I might be able to contribute.

A huge thanks to Stephen, John and Nic for having me - it was a great experience. Looking forward to hearing from their future guest hosts.

On the topic of podcasts, I'd recommend the following recent non-Drupal podcasts that I thought were especially great:

- [Shop Talk Show 451](https://shoptalkshow.com/451/): JavaScript and Web Components with Nolan Lawson
- [Syntax 330](https://syntax.fm/show/330/react-query-more-react-with-tanner-linsley): React Query + More React with Tanner Linsley
