_This is a living post that will be updated as I watch many, many movies. Last update: 2025-02-05_

For the past handful of years I've made a point to watch all of the films nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. Here are my quick thoughts on what I've seen so far this year, along with some bonus films I've seen from other nominated categories.

### My Favorite So Far

- [A Real Pain](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21823606/) - A funny yet touching look at generational trauma. Kieran Culkin is great, even if he's squarely in his wheelhouse. And really appreciate that it is a tightly structured 90 minutes that doesn't outstay its welcome.

### Best Picture Nominees

- [The Substance](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt17526714/) - I love that a movie this fucked up made the cut. I have some structural problems with it, especially in the third act, but I don't think a movie like this really cares about structure, logic, or reality. Enjoyed the disorienting way it was shot once I settled in, and boy oh boy those last few scenes. Too many needles though.

- [Dune: Part Two](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15239678/) - did nothing for me unfortunately. Couldn't remember enough of the first one, and generally found most of the movie baffling. Impressive to look at though.

### Other Nominated Films

- [The Wild Robot](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt29623480/) - a great adaptation of a book that my son **loved** when he was younger. The animation is beautiful, but it tried to squeeze in too many competing themes in the third act.

- [Inside Out 2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22022452/) - Pales in comparison to the first unfortunately. And I'm still mad that [they low-balled some of the original voice cast](https://people.com/why-did-mindy-kaling-bill-hader-not-return-inside-out-2-8665675).

- [Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt17163970/) - Fun! Best use of creepy gnomes for sure. I haven't seen other Wallace & Gromit films, but the way Wallace was oblivious to Gromit's feelings bummed me out a little bit. They should break up.
