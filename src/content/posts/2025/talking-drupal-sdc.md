I was a guest this week on the [Talking Drupal podcast](https://talkingdrupal.com) to discuss my experience working with Single Directory Components in Drupal. I had a chance to use them extensively on a recent client project and developed a workflow that I was pretty happy with.

It was a great conversation, covering both the basics of Single Directory Components, how Iâ€™ve been using them, and how I see Single Directory Components evolving in future versions of Drupal.
