I took an extended holiday break this year to match my family's school vacations. That means I'm bracing for a return to reality after the Christmas holiday, a New Year for the world, and a new year for me (44!)

## 2023

- Pitch-burgh - lots of work in the decoupled space

- Fest, The State

- New Couch! Pool!

- Junior High - Track and Drums

- Florida Drupal Camp, MidCamp, Visited SF offices, Twin Cities, NEDCamp

- Root canal

- 150 hours of Tears of the Kingdom

- A terrible Pats season

## 2024

Feels like a year of transition.

- New site!

- API Client - close out Pitch-burgh commitment, which should open up some new possibilities. I have an idea for a new open source project that builds on this work.

- Work - new challenges one way or another.

- Steam deck.

- Dry-ish January / fitness
