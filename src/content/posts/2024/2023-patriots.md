As a Patriots fan, 2023 was quite the rude awakening. It has been rough going since Brady left (and retired multiple times,) but this was different. I've been a Patriots fan long enough that I experienced many, many bad seasons pre-Brady so I knew it was somewhat inevitable, but I had wondered exactly what it would be like experiencing the basement of the NFL after such a long dynasty. Would it infuriate me? Would I give up and lose my rooting interest entirely? Would I even be able to show my face in the Chicagoland area if the Pats have a worse record than the Bears?

The good news is that I enjoyed this no good, very bad season much more than I expected.

Belichick / Mayo.
