I was a guest on a recent episode of [Talking Drupal](https://talkingdrupal.com/) to discuss the Drupal API Client. Always a great time participating in the show. Thanks to my [bio page](https://talkingdrupal.com/brian-perry) on their new website, I see that this is my 8th appearance on the show - four times as a guest, and four times as a guest host.

We talked about the basics of the API Client, participating in the Pitch-burgh competition, the future of the project, and some of the challenges describing a primarily JavaScript focused project to an audience that typically thinks Drupal first.

You can watch or listen to the episode below, on [the episode page on talkingdrupal.com](https://talkingdrupal.com/454), or in your podcast player of choice.
