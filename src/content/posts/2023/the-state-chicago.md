It isn't a stretch to say that the 90s sketch comedy group [The State](https://davidwain.com/thestate) are one of my all-time biggest influences. Not only did the show lead me to years of performing comedy, but I also learned html in order to create an impressively ugly fan site.

I previously saw The State live just after their MTV show ended, at the now defunct [Carolines](https://www.carolines.com/) in Times Square. If you told me then that I'd bring my wife to see them in Chicago in 2023, I would have had a few questions. But I wouldn't be suprised to hear that those sketches meant as much to me in 2023 as they did back when MTV actually played music videos. Getting a chance to relive those sketches without having to break out a VHS bootleg was pure joy.
